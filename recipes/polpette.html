        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine sausage, ground beef, shallot, Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. 
            Use a wooden spoon to break up the ground meat and roughly mix ingredients together. 
            Stir in beaten eggs, milk, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix all ingredients well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour water into a shallow bowl, and moisten fingertips and palms with water. 
            Shape meatball mixture into about 40 ping-pong sized balls and place on the prepared sheet pan. 
            When fingers become sticky, dip them in water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a bit underdone in the center, about 20 minutes. 
            If meatballs are larger, adjust baking time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour tomato pur√©e into a large sauce pot or a Dutch oven set over medium-low heat. 
            Stir in minced garlic and Italian herbs. 
            Sample the sauce for seasoning, and adjust, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            When sauce begins to bubble slightly, add meatballs and stir gently, coating all the meatballs with sauce. 
            Keep meatballs and sauce at a low simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, place meatballs and sauce on a plate, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, garnish with fresh basil leaves, 
            and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
