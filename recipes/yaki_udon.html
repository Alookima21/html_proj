        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package udon noodles</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package snow peas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, Worcestershire, sesame oil, sugar, Sriracha, and garlic in a small bowl; set aside. 
            Remove root ends from scallions and discard. Chop whites and light greens into 2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set aside. 
            Thinly slice remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for garnish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on first side, about 3 minutes. 
            Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4 more minutes. 
            Add bok choy, carrots, sliced whites and light greens of scallions, and 1/4 cup water to pan with mushrooms. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently separating noodles with tongs or spoon. 
            Add reserved oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are well-coated, about 1 minute. 
            Divide among serving bowls and garnish with reserved sliced greens of scallions and optional garnishes. 
            Serve immediately.
